# Event Hook Triggering

`on_triggered()` is called each time one of the subscribed events fires. The `event`
argument carries all information about what occurred:

```python
async def on_triggered(self, event) -> None:
    if event.event_type in self.environment.counts:
        self.environment.counts[event.event_type] += 1

    self.logger.info("[{}] {}", event.event_type, event.message)
```

## The Event object

| Attribute          | Type        | Description                                           |
|--------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `event.event_type` | `EventType` | The event identifier that fired                       |
| `event.message`    | `str`       | Human-readable description of what happened           |
| `event.data`       | `dict`      | Structured data payload (contents vary by event type) |

`event.to_json()` returns `{"event_type": str, "message": str, "data": dict}`.

## Branching on event type

When an event hook subscribes to multiple event types that need different handling,
branch on `event.event_type`:

```python
async def on_triggered(self, event) -> None:
    self._record_event(event)

    if event.event_type == EventType.AGENT_REGISTERED:
        self.logger.success("New agent connected: {}", event.message)
    elif event.event_type == EventType.AGENT_DEREGISTERED:
        self.logger.info("Agent disconnected: {}", event.message)
    elif event.event_type == EventType.AGENT_TASKED:
        self.logger.info("Task dispatched: {}", event.message)
    elif event.event_type == EventType.AGENT_TASK_COMPLETED:
        self.logger.success("Task completed: {}", event.message)
    else:
        self.logger.debug("[{}] {}", event.event_type, event.message)
```

## Async code in on_triggered

Because `on_triggered()` is an async coroutine you can freely `await` inside it:

```python
async def on_triggered(self, event) -> None:
    await self._post_to_external_api(event)
    await asyncio.sleep(0)  # yield control back to the event loop if needed
```

## Concurrency and re-entrancy

Every handler subscribed to an event runs concurrently, so a slow `on_triggered()` no
longer delays delivery to other hooks or to connected websocket clients. Routine network
I/O inside `on_triggered()` is fine and does not need to be offloaded just to keep the
event pipeline moving.

`on_triggered()` is also re-entrant. Each trigger is dispatched as an independent task,
so a second event can enter `on_triggered()` before an earlier call has returned. Two
consequences when writing a hook:

- Do not assume calls to your hook are serialised, and do not assume events arrive in
  the order they were triggered. No ordering is guaranteed between hooks or between
  triggers.
- State mutated across an `await` needs a lock. State read and written without an
  intervening `await` is safe, because the event loop cannot switch coroutines partway
  through a step.

```python
async def on_setup(self) -> None:
    self.environment.counts = {}
    self.environment.pending = 0
    self.environment.lock = asyncio.Lock()


async def on_triggered(self, event) -> None:
    # Safe: no `await` between the read and the write, so no other call can interleave.
    self.environment.counts[event.event_type] = (
        self.environment.counts.get(event.event_type, 0) + 1
    )

    # Needs the lock: the value is read, awaited across, then written. Without it a
    # second call can read the same value before this one writes it back.
    async with self.environment.lock:
        pending = self.environment.pending + 1
        await self._flush(pending)
        self.environment.pending = 0
```

## Offloading with create_task

Offloading is still useful for genuine fire-and-forget work that the framework should
not wait on at all, such as work that should outlive the trigger:

```python
async def on_triggered(self, event) -> None:
    # Schedule the work as a background task and return immediately
    asyncio.create_task(self._send_webhook(event))
```

The task runs independently, so the events service cannot collect its failures.
Raising `EventHookTriggerError` inside that task does not change this. To use the
framework's structured failure reporting, await the work within `on_triggered()`
and raise the signal exception there (see below). If work must outlive the trigger,
keep its task reference and handle its failures explicitly, for example by logging
them inside the background coroutine.

Note also that a task created this way is not cancelled when the trigger is, so it can
outlive server shutdown. Keep a reference to it and cancel it in `on_teardown()` if that
matters for your hook.

## Signalling trigger failures

Raise `EventHookTriggerError` from `on_triggered()` to signal that handling this
particular event failed. The events service remaps it to the consortium-level
`EventHookTriggerError`, preserving your `message` and `detail`, and collects it
alongside any other handler failures for that event. It does not stop other hooks (or
other handlers) subscribed to the same event from running.

```python
from consortium.framework.signal_exceptions.event_hooks_signal_exceptions import (
    EventHookTriggerError,
)


async def on_triggered(self, event) -> None:
    try:
        await self._post_to_external_api(event)
    except Exception as exc:
        raise EventHookTriggerError(
            message=f"Failed to post event to external API: {exc}",
            detail={"event_type": str(event.event_type)},
        ) from exc
```

Do not catch and log a failure internally and swallow it, and do not let it escape as a
bare, unhandled exception. Both approaches used to be considered acceptable for event
hooks; now that `EventHookTriggerError` exists, raise it instead so failures are
reported through the same structured `code`/`message`/`detail` shape as every other
framework error.

Continue to [Event Hook Teardown](event-hook-teardown.md) to clean up on shutdown.
