# Roles and Permissions

Access to the server is governed by **roles**. Every user account is assigned a role (see
[User Accounts](user-accounts.md)), and each role grants a set of fine grained
**permissions**, where every permission authorizes a single action against the server's
REST API or Events WebSockets API.

By default, the server loads its roles from `data/server/role_permissions.json`. This file
maps each role name to the list of permissions that role grants.

```json title="role_permissions.json"
{
    "ADMIN": [
        "CREATE_USER_ACCOUNT",
        "READ_ALL_USER_ACCOUNTS",
        "CREATE_LISTENER",
        "..."
    ],
    "OPERATOR": [
        "READ_OWN_USER_ACCOUNT",
        "CREATE_LISTENER",
        "..."
    ],
    "SPECTATOR": [
        "READ_ALL_LISTENERS",
        "READ_ALL_AGENTS",
        "..."
    ]
}
```

## Customizing roles

You can tailor the permissions of the built in roles, or define entirely new roles, by
editing `role_permissions.json`:

- **Add or remove a permission** by editing the permission list for a role.
- **Create a new role** by adding a new top level key whose value is the list of
  permissions it grants. Any account assigned that role name in
  [`user_accounts.json`](user-accounts.md) then receives those permissions.
- **Remove a role** by deleting its key. Make sure no user account still references a role
  before removing it.

!!! warning
    Every entry in a role's permission list must be a valid permission string. Unknown
    permission strings are rejected when the file is loaded and the server will fail to
    start. The valid permission strings are listed in the [permission
    catalog](#permission-catalog) below.

## Permission catalog

The permissions below are the complete set the server recognizes. They are grouped by the
REST API endpoint (or Events WebSockets API) they authorize.

particular agent; there are no separate permissions for these agent filters.
